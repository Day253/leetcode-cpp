\section{Word Frequency (loj192)} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:word-frequency}


\subsubsection{描述}
Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file \fn{words.txt}.
For simplicity sake, you may assume:
\begindot
\item \fn{words.txt} contains only lowercase characters and space \fn{' '} characters.
\item Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.
\item Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.
\myenddot
For example, assume that \fn{words.txt} has the following content:
\begin{Code}
the day is sunny the the
the sunny is is
\end{Code}
Your script should output the following, sorted by descending frequency:
\begin{Code}
the 4
is 3
sunny 2
day 1
\end{Code}

\textbf{Note:}

Don't worry about handling ties, it is guaranteed that each word's frequency count is unique.

\textbf{Hint:}

Could you write it in one-line using Unix pipes?
